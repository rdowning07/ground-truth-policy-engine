# Curriculum: 30-Hour Backend Fluency CLI

**Session format (every time):**
1) Primitive lesson (what we’re training)
2) Business paragraph (how it shows up in the wild)
3) Implement translation (learner writes)
4) Critique + tighten

## Phase 1 — Deterministic evaluation (Hours 1–6)
- Primitive: loops, conditionals, accumulators
- Output: evaluate one rule across many records with structured results

## Phase 2 — Guard clauses + validation (Hours 7–12)
- Primitive: validation first, early exit patterns
- Output: deny safely on missing/invalid data, return validation failures distinctly

## Phase 3 — Rule composition (Hours 13–18)
- Primitive: rule functions, structured returns, failure accumulation, priority ordering
- Output: multi-rule evaluation producing allow/deny + reasons

## Phase 4 — Decomposition (Hours 19–22)
- Primitive: function boundaries, orchestration vs evaluation
- Output: clean separations (validate, evaluate, format)

## Phase 5 — Stateful CLI (Hours 23–28)
- Primitive: command loop, dispatch, controlled mutation, separation of I/O and logic
- Output: add/list/evaluate users from an in-memory store

## Phase 6 — Rebuild (Hours 29–30)
- Primitive: rebuild from blank file without reference
- Output: reproduce core engine structure from memory
